These are the histogram of USArrests.

```{r hist(swiss$Examination)}
hist(USArrests$Murder)
hist(USArrests$Rape)
hist(USArrests$Assault)
hist(USArrests$UrbanPop)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
